        Hey! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Hedvig and I made this app. Itâ€™s for all of us that
        some times experience difficulties common up with tunes to start at the
        session. The idea is to save all the tunes you know, and the ones you
        want to learn. Then go to other members to se what tunes you have in
        common. ðŸŽ»
