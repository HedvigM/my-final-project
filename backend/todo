I have made a new login system that messes with the whole app... I can now use google to sign in Yey! But i need to update the rest of the app accordingly.

I have changed the memberschema in the server.js, and the sign up endpoint. Now i need to change the rest of the endpoints.

The log out function is not working at the moment. The function that redirected before is not doing its job, so i removed it in the meantime.

TODO: 3. the members page dont work at the moment.
-Nu kan man spara en medlem, fast i postman står det "false" som att requestet inte gått igenom.

- man kan spara en och samma vän flera gånger.

4. Do a refactoring on the server.js document and make smaller components.

5. Incorporate the lottie! =)
6. Look at the mobile version thingie.

If i were to change anything:

- rename "login" and loginscreen to "startpage" or "startscreen".
- Make it possible to save a town on profile component.
- möjlighet att "unfollow" en person på "search member" sidan.
