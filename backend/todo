I have made a new login system that messes with the whole app... I can now use google to sign in Yey! But i need to update the rest of the app accordingly. 

I have changed the memberschema in the server.js, and the sign up endpoint. Now i need to change the rest of the endpoints. 

The log out function is not working at the moment. The function that redirected before is not doing its job, so i removed it in the meantime. 

TODO:
3. look at the redirects, the '/' should lead to the 'login' page... and then the profile page should have right redirects. 

3b. add the 'login' as a choise to the header. 

4. Do a refactoring on the server.js document and make smaller components. 

5. Incorporate the lottie! =) 
6. Look at the mobile version thingie.
